# Nate's Flask-React Template

Uses Vite to serve frontend and Flask serves the backend.

## To Use

1. On github choose "use as a template"
2. Clone
3. Open up the backend and frontend in separate workspaces
4. In the backend
   1. activate the `.venv`
   2. install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   3. run `flask --debug run`
5. In the frontend,
   1. run `npm install`
   2. run `npm run dev`

Should be good to go.
